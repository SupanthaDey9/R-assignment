Hey Supantha!

Your code looks great. Your methods are very efficient, especially using a function to write each csv. 

Your plots actually made me realize I may have done them wrong!! They look really good and I like that you customized all the plot labels, colors, titles, etc. I wish you chose something more "new" for your third analysis instead of pulling one column from the group bar plot.
Also, for future reference, the dim() function gives you both the number of columns and rows for a data frame. And file.info() gives you the file size in bytes.

My biggest critique would be that you need to have a R-Markdown file in your repository. Your code looks good but you have no markdown file to run and get results.

Thanks!
Rabsa
